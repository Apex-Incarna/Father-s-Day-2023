            <p>Dearest Father, I am so incredibly grateful to be your son! Thank you so much, first and foremost, for how you have trained me up to love the Lord; I have both you and Mommy to thank for introducing me to my heavenly Father. Thank you for how you love me and how you love Mommy and how you love our family, and that I never have to worry, as some of my friends do, that my parents might stop loving each other or stop loving me. Thank you for how you’ve always pushed me hard in the areas you know are good for me, like getting a job, driving, and even just simply cutting the grass; without you, I’d certainly be a sluggard. I love all of the times we get to hang out and watch a movie, and I especially love when you have something to show me on your phone, because it always is something funny or cool that we get to talk about. I think you are so wise and so knowledgeable, and I envy your hardworking spirit, your tenacity, and your knack for everything from building decks to tv repair. I am so blessed to have you as my Daddy, so I wanted to say “thank you” and wish you a Happy Father’s Day!</p>
            <h2 class="center">"But you know what I always say: 'Speak softly, and drive a big tank!'"</h2>
